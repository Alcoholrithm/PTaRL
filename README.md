# PyTorch Lightning implementation of PTaRL: Prototype-based Tabular Representation Learning via Space Calibration

Welcome to the PyTorch Lightning implementation of PTaRL: Prototype-based Tabular Representation Learning via Space Calibration ([ICLR'2024](https://openreview.net/forum?id=G32oY4Vnm8&referrer=%5Bthe%20profile%20of%20Hangting%20Ye%5D(%2Fprofile%3Fid%3D~Hangting_Ye1))). 

This project is an unofficial implementation and was developed to mirror the methods described in the PTaRL paper as closely as possible. 

We have observed discrepancies in the loss function between the paper under review and the code available in the official GitHub repository.

Our implementation is based on the latter.

Since this is an unofficial implementation, updates will be made to align with future official releases or the camera-ready version of the PTaRL paper.

# Getting Started

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
